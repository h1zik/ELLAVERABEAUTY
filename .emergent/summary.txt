<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Pages:** Landing Page, Our Clients, Products, Articles, About Us, Contact, and Admin Dashboard.
- **Admin Panel:** Full control over all page content (text, images, sections), theme customization, lead management, and CRUD for Products, Articles, and Clients.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in **Indonesian**. The next agent MUST respond in Indonesian.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The initial problem of connecting the admin panel to the live site has been solved. The website is now almost fully dynamic.

Key completed features include:
- **Dynamic Content:** All pages (Homepage, About, Contact) and the Footer now pull content from the backend, editable in the admin panel.
- **Admin Panel Enhancements:**
    - **Clients & Reviews:** Separated into two distinct sections with full CRUD management.
    - **Content Editor:** Now supports adding/removing items from lists (e.g., services, features, process steps).
    - **Page Builder:** A new tab allows the admin to show/hide and reorder homepage sections via drag-and-drop.
    - **Site Settings:** Supports dynamic contact info and image uploads for the site logo.
- **Frontend Features:**
    - **Sliders:** Auto-sliding carousels for Client logos and Testimonials are implemented and functional on the homepage.
    - **Redesigned Sections:** The Process Steps section has been redesigned into a visually appealing flow diagram.
    - **Related Content:** Related Products and Related Articles sections appear on their respective detail pages.
    - **Adaptive Layouts:** Card grids (e.g., for Services) are now responsive and center-align correctly regardless of the number of items.
    - **Hero Customization:** The homepage hero section supports a static image, video, or image carousel background, with options managed from the admin panel.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Debugging the Carousel background option for the hero section. The user selected this option and uploaded images, but the slideshow is not appearing on the live homepage. The agent confirmed the data was saved correctly in the backend and was about to investigate the frontend for JavaScript or rendering errors.
-   **Status:** 
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N (Debugging in progress)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**  with console log capture. Use . This will reveal JavaScript errors from the Swiper component, which are the most likely cause.
-   **User Testing Done:** N (User reported the bug)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** Hero section slideshow background does not work. (Priority: P0)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Description:** When the Carousel background type is selected for the homepage hero section, the uploaded images do not display as a slideshow. Other background types (static image) work correctly.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has confirmed that the backend is successfully saving the uploaded image data (as base64 strings) for the hero section. The issue is on the frontend.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Use  to check for browser console errors. Pay close attention to any warnings or errors from the Swiper.js library.
        2.  View . Examine the conditional rendering block for the hero section background, specifically the case for .
        3.  Verify that the Swiper component inside this block is correctly initialized. Ensure the  array () is being passed correctly to the Swiper slides.
        4.  Check if all necessary Swiper modules (e.g., , , , ) are imported from  and included in the Swiper component's  prop. A missing module is a common cause of failure.
        5.  Inspect the CSS. Ensure the Swiper container and its parent elements are visible and have a defined height.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will complete the advanced hero customization feature requested by the user, giving them full control over the homepage's most prominent section.
    -   **Status:** 
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
There are no other tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Expand Page Builder to All Pages:** The  component currently only manages homepage sections. It needs to be enhanced with a dropdown to select other pages (About, Contact, etc.) to allow section reordering and visibility toggling across the entire site.
    -   **P1: Enhance Admin Theme Customization:** Implement remaining theme options from the original spec, such as changing typography (heading/body fonts).
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2:** Multi-language Support.
    -   **P2:** Evolve the content editor into a more advanced, module-based page builder.
    -   **P3:** Implement automatic image optimization on upload.
    -   **P3:** Create a versioning system to save and restore previous versions of page content.
    -   **P3:** Integrate an in-browser PDF viewer for product documents.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Swiper.js for carousels,  for drag-and-drop, React Context API for global state (), Tailwind CSS for styling.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic for robust data modeling (was the source of a critical bug), Motor for async MongoDB.
-   **State Management:** A global  was introduced to ensure components like the  react instantly to changes made in the admin panel (e.g., logo update).

**key DB schema**
-   : {username, email, hashed_password, role}
-   : {name, description, category_name, images, documents}
-   : {title, content, author, category_name}
-   : {name, logo_url} (testimonial and rating moved to )
-   : {client_name, testimonial, rating, position} (New collection)
-   : {page_name, sections: [{section_type, content, order, is_visible}]}
-   : {site_name, logo_url, contact_info, social_links}

**All files of reference**
-   : The most complex component. Contains the logic for the dynamic hero background. **This is the primary file to investigate for the current bug.**
-   : Contains the admin UI for managing the hero background options.
-   : Contains the Pydantic models and API endpoints. Was previously patched to fix a critical bug with saving .
-   : New file for managing global settings state, which solved a logo refresh issue.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Current Bug:** The immediate priority is to fix the non-functional hero section slideshow. Start by using the  with  to check for JavaScript errors in . The issue is likely a misconfiguration of the Swiper component or a missing module import.
2.  **User Language:** Continue all communication in **Indonesian**.
3.  **Swiper.js Issues:** The agent has fixed several bugs related to Swiper.js carousels (looping, responsive breakpoints). The current bug is likely similar. Be mindful of Swiper's configuration requirements.
4.  **Admin Credentials:** Use  /  to test any admin-related functionality.
