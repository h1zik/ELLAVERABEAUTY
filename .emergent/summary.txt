<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a fully responsive, premium-grade cosmetic manufacturing website called Ellavera Beauty. The website must be elegant, modern, and professional, with a primary requirement for all content on all pages to be fully customizable through a comprehensive admin panel.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Pages:** Landing Page, Our Clients, Products, Articles, About Us, Contact, Gallery, and Admin Dashboard.
- **Admin Panel:** Full control over all page content (text, images, sections), theme customization, lead management, and CRUD for Products, Articles, Clients, Services, Gallery, and Categories.
- **Key Functionality:**
    - Dynamic content arrays (e.g., add/remove features or services).
    - Section visibility control and reordering.
    - Sliders/Carousels for clients and reviews.
    - Customizable Hero Section with multiple background options (Image, Video, Carousel) and text colors.
    - File uploads for logos and content images.
- **Design:** Elegant, modern, with a cyan and white theme.

**User's preferred language**: The user communicates in **Indonesian**. The next agent MUST respond in Indonesian.

**what currently exists?**
A comprehensive full-stack application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The website is almost entirely dynamic, with content managed through a newly redesigned, professional admin dashboard.

Key features include:
- **Full CRUD Modules:** The admin panel supports complete create, read, update, and delete functionality for Products, Articles, Clients, Reviews, a dedicated Gallery, and Services.
- **Centralized Category Management:** A new admin section allows for creating, editing, and deleting categories for both Products and Articles, ensuring no overlap.
- **Redesigned Admin Dashboard:** The previous tab-based UI has been replaced with a modern sidebar navigation, a statistical overview, quick actions, and a cleaner layout.
- **Advanced Customization:**
    - **Hero Section:** Fully customizable with options for background type (image, video, carousel), smooth 'fade' transitions, and individual text color controls for the badge, title, and description.
    - **Dynamic Pages:** New dedicated pages for Services (with detail pages) and Gallery (with filters and multiple view modes) have been added.
    - **Content Management:** The About Us page sections (Certifications, Team) and the website Footer are now fully editable from the admin panel.
- **Bug Fixes:** Numerous UI/UX bugs have been resolved, including the header's background on scroll, misaligned elements in the Process section, and a faulty WhatsApp button.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent fixed two user-reported issues:
    1.  Product and Article categories were mixed up in the admin panel. This was caused by a duplicate route in , which has now been removed.
    2.  The category selection dropdown in admin forms had a transparent background, making it unreadable. This was fixed by adding an explicit background color to the UI component.
-   **Status:** 
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Verified via screenshots that categories are now separate).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** . The agent should visually confirm the dropdown UI fix by taking a screenshot of the Add Product or Add Article modal inside the admin panel.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no known pending issues. The last reported items have been addressed and are awaiting user verification.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Expand Page Builder to All Pages:** The  component currently only manages homepage sections. It needs to be enhanced with a dropdown to select other pages (About, Contact, etc.) to allow section reordering and visibility toggling across the entire site.
    -   **P1: Enhance Admin Theme Customization:** Implement remaining theme options, such as changing typography (heading/body fonts).
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2:** Multi-language Support.
    -   **P2:** Evolve the content editor into a more advanced, module-based page builder.
    -   **P3:** Implement automatic image optimization on upload.
    -   **P3:** Create a versioning system to save and restore previous versions of page content.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Swiper.js, , React Context API, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor (async MongoDB).
-   **Development Pattern:** A recurring pattern in this session was converting static or semi-dynamic sections into full-fledged, independent CRUD modules (e.g., Services, Gallery, Categories). This involved creating backend models/routes, frontend admin components, and public-facing pages.
-   **Debugging:** Successfully diagnosed and resolved complex backend issues, including duplicate routes causing incorrect data retrieval.

**key DB schema**
-   : {username, email, hashed_password, role}
-   : {name, description, category_id, images, documents}
-   : {title, content, author, category_id}
-   : {name, logo_url}
-   : {client_name, testimonial, rating, position}
-   : {page_name, sections: [{section_type, content, order, is_visible}]}
-   : {site_name, logo_url, contact_info, social_links, footer_description, footer_links}
-   : {id, name, short_description, full_description, icon, features, benefits, featured} (NEW)
-   : {id, title, image_url, category, featured} (NEW)
-   : {id, name, slug, description, type, order} (NEW, replaces old schema)

**changes in tech stack**
-   No changes to the core technologies.

**All files of reference**
-   : The monolithic backend file containing all new models and routes for Services, Gallery, and Categories. It was heavily modified and debugged.
-   : Completely rewritten to implement the new admin UI/UX.
-   : Modified to conditionally render the Header and Footer, creating a separate layout for the admin area.
-   : New file for the category management UI.
-   : New file for the service management UI.
-   : New file for the gallery management UI.
-   , : New files for the public services section.
-   : New file for the public gallery.
-   : Modified to fix a dropdown background color bug.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   ** is a monolith.** It contains all models, routes, and business logic. For better scalability and maintainability, it should be refactored into a structured directory (e.g., , , ). Propose this to the user as a necessary code health improvement.

**key api endpoints**
-    &  (Full CRUD)
-    &  (Full CRUD)
-    (Full CRUD, filterable by  or )

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Backend Refactoring:** The  file has grown too large. Your first proposal to the user should be to refactor this monolith into a more organized structure (e.g., separate folders for routes, models, etc.). This is crucial for future development.
2.  **Admin Session Behavior:** When testing the admin panel with tools like , the session may appear to be lost, redirecting to the login page. This is a testing artifact. Ensure your test flows include the login step each time you need to access an authenticated admin route.
3.  **User Language:** Continue all communication in **Indonesian**.
4.  **Admin Credentials:** Use  /  to test any admin-related functionality.
