<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a fully responsive, premium-grade cosmetic manufacturing website called Ellavera Beauty. The website must look elegant, modern, clean, luxurious, and professional, with a strong emphasis on full customization through an admin panel.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Pages:** Landing Page, Our Clients, Products (with detail page), Articles/Blog (with detail page), About Us, Contact, and a comprehensive Admin Dashboard.
- **User Roles:** Normal User (browser) and Admin (full control).
- **Admin Panel Features:**
    - Theme Customization (colors, typography, layout, light/dark mode).
    - Content Management for Products, Articles, Clients.
    - Full Page Customization: All text, images, and sections on every page should be editable from the admin panel.
    - Lead Form Tracking.
- **Key Functionality:**
    - File uploads for product documents (MSDS, COA) and images.
    - Smooth scroll-based animations and micro-interactions.
    - SEO optimization.
    - Secure JWT-based authentication for the admin panel.
- **Optional/Future Features:** Multi-language support, WhatsApp floating button, image optimization, versioning system, and a document viewer.
- **Design:** Elegant, soft pastels or gold accents, minimalistic, luxury typography, inspired by brands like SK-II and Shiseido. The user specified a **Cyan and White** color theme.

**User's preferred language**: The user has been communicating in Indonesian. The next agent MUST respond in **Indonesian**.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been built using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It features a sophisticated UI with a cyan and white theme and scroll animations. Key pages (Landing, Products, Articles, About, Contact, Clients) have been created. A secure admin dashboard is functional, allowing management of products, articles, clients, and leads. A content editor UI has been built under the Page Content tab in the admin panel, allowing the admin to input content for the Homepage and About page sections. However, the live pages are not yet connected to this system and still display hardcoded content.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was tasked with fixing an issue where content edited in the admin Page Content editor was not appearing on the live website. The agent correctly diagnosed that the frontend pages (, ) are still using hardcoded content and need to be updated to fetch data from the backend API. The agent acknowledged the problem and stated the plan to fix it but did not implement any code changes.
-   **Status:** 
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. After implementation, the agent should test the flow by:
    1.  Navigating to the Admin Dashboard -> Page Content.
    2.  Editing a piece of text (e.g., the Hero section title) and saving it.
    3.  Navigating to the live homepage to verify that the text has been updated.
    4.  Using the screenshot tool to capture before and after evidence.
-   **User Testing Done:** N (User reported the bug)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** Content edited in the admin panel does not reflect on the live pages. (Priority: P0)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Description:** The user has reported that after editing content in the Page Content section of the admin dashboard, the changes are not visible on the live Homepage or About page. The frontend is still displaying static, hardcoded text.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The agent only identified the cause.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  In , use  and the  utility to fetch data from the  endpoint.
        2.  Store the fetched page content in a state variable (e.g., ).
        3.  Replace the hardcoded text, images, and button links throughout the  component with the dynamic data from the state.
        4.  Implement loading and error states to handle the async data fetching.
        5.  Repeat the same process for , fetching from .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical fix to deliver the core user requirement of a fully customizable website managed via the admin panel.
    -   **Status:** 
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
There are no other tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Enhance Admin Theme Customization:**
        -   Implement controls to change typography and header layout.
        -   Implement functionality to reorder, hide, and show homepage sections from the admin panel. The backend model  has an  field, but the frontend UI and logic are not yet implemented.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2: Multi-language Support:** Add a system for managing English and Indonesian content from the admin panel.
    -   **P2: Advanced Page Builder:** Evolve the current content editor into a more flexible, module-based page builder.
    -   **P3: Image Optimization:** Implement automatic image compression on upload.
    -   **P3: Versioning System:** Allow admins to save and restore previous versions of page content.
    -   **P3: PDF Document Viewer:** Integrate an in-browser PDF viewer on the product detail page instead of just a download link.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React,  for routing,  for API calls, Shadcn UI for components, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic for data modeling, Motor for async MongoDB operations,  for JWT,  for password hashing.
-   **Database:** MongoDB.
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for securing admin routes.

**key DB schema**
-   : {username, email, hashed_password, role}
-   : {name, description, category, images, documents, featured}
-   : {title, content, author, cover_image, category}
-   : {name, logo, testimonial, rating}
-   : {page_name, sections: [{section_type, content, order, is_visible}]}
-   : {site_name, logo_url, tagline, footer_text, contact_info, social_links}
-   : {product_id, name, url, file_type}

**changes in tech stack**
-   None. The stack remains React, FastAPI, and MongoDB.

**All files**
-   : The main FastAPI application, containing all API routes, database models (Pydantic), and logic for the entire application.
-   : The root React component that sets up routing for all pages.
-   : A crucial utility file containing all frontend functions for making API calls to the backend.
-   : The homepage component. **(Needs refactoring to use dynamic content)**.
-   : The About Us page component. **(Needs refactoring to use dynamic content)**.
-   : The main layout for the admin panel, which uses tabs to render different management components.
-   : The new UI component for editing page content section by section.
-   : The utility that handles scroll-based animations. It has been a source of bugs related to content visibility.
-   : A script that populates the database with the initial structure and content for the editable pages.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   : Must be refactored to remove all hardcoded content and fetch it dynamically from the API.
-   : Must be refactored to remove all hardcoded content and fetch it dynamically from the API.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Login and token endpoints.
-   : CRUD for products.
-   : CRUD for articles.
-   : CRUD for clients.
-   : GET for contact form leads.
-   : GET and PUT endpoints to manage dynamic page content.
-   : GET and PUT endpoints for global site settings.
-   : POST endpoint for uploading images.
-   : POST endpoint for uploading product documents.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
1.  **Highest Priority:** The user's main goal is a **fully customizable website**. The immediate task is to connect the frontend pages (, ) to the backend API so that edits made in the admin Page Content editor are reflected live. This is not working and is the reason for the current handover.
2.  **User Language:** The user communicates in **Indonesian**. You must continue the conversation in Indonesian.
3.  **Scroll Animations:** The scroll animation logic in  and  has previously caused elements to be invisible (). Be cautious when modifying this, as it has been a recurring source of visual bugs.
4.  **Admin Credentials:** Use the provided credentials to test all admin-related functionality.

**documents created in this job**
-   : Seeds initial products, clients, and the admin user.
-   : Seeds initial site settings.
-   : Seeds the content structure for the Homepage and About page.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Requests full customization for all content on Homepage, About, and other pages.
2.  **Agent:** Acknowledges and implements a Content Editor in the admin panel to manage page content. Seeds initial data.
3.  **Agent:** Shows a screenshot of the new Page Content editor in the admin panel, declaring it a success.
4.  **User:** Reports that after trying to edit the content, the changes do not appear on the live website. **(This is the current pending issue)**.
5.  **Agent:** Acknowledges the issue, correctly identifies that the frontend pages are using hardcoded content, and states the intention to fix it by connecting them to the database.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Working:** Backend API, database, admin authentication, CRUD for products/articles/clients, file uploads, site settings, content editor UI.
-   **Broken:** The link between the content editor and the live pages. The core feature of dynamic content is not functional, which is a major failure point for the user's primary requirement.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES, once early in the process.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** The scroll-reveal animations have caused content to become invisible multiple times. Any changes to this feature should be tested thoroughly to ensure content remains visible on page load.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Email:** 
-   **Password:** 

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent correctly diagnosed that the  and  components needed to be modified to fetch dynamic content from the API. However, the agent was forked before any of the necessary code edits in those files were made. The entire implementation of this fix is pending.</analysis>
